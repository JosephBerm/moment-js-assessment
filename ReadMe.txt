The questions are in order but for your convenience I have added TODOs on every question.
Below every question, I have left the console.log's that I used to test the code. If
you have any questions or doubts concerning my code, please feel free to reach out to me.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

P.S This was my first time working with moment.js and I thought it was a really handy tool.
